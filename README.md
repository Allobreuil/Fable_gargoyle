## ‚ö° Installation

### 1. Electronics
- Open the `hardware/` folder in **KiCad** to check the schematic and PCB.  
- Assemble and solder the listed components.  
- Connect the speaker and the motion sensor according to the schematic.  

### 2. Software
1. Install the Arduino IDE and ESP32 drivers.  
2. Add ESP32 board support in the Arduino IDE.  
3. Open the `software/` folder.  
4. Flash the code named **`Gargoyle_V2`** to the Arduino Nano ESP32.  

### 3. 3D Model
- The files in the `3d_model/` folder can be used to 3D print the gargoyle.  
- The folder also includes a **split version of the gargoyle**, divided into several parts to make large-scale printing easier.  
- You can adjust the model to your needs (size, material, color).

## üìñ User Manual

1. **Prepare the SD card**  
   - Copy all the `.mp3` files from the `sounds_fr/` folder.  
   - Paste them onto a FAT32-formatted SD card.  
   - Insert the SD card into the MP3 module.  

2. **Flash the Arduino**  
   - Open `Gargoyle_V2` in the `software/` folder with the Arduino IDE.  
   - Select the **Arduino Nano ESP32** board in the IDE.  
   - Flash the program to the microcontroller.  

3. **Assemble the system**  
   - Solder the components according to the KiCad schematic (`hardware/`).  
   - Insert the Arduino into the circuit.  
   - Connect the speaker, motion sensor, switch, and regulator.  
   - Power the system with a 9V battery.  

4. **Usage**  
   - Once powered on, the system is ready.  
   - When the **HC-SR501 motion sensor** detects movement in front of the gargoyle,  
     the Arduino plays a **random sound** from the SD card through the speaker.
